#BIS Export Data Portal

Cleaning BIS Data of Proprietary Information for use on the BIS data portal

##Introduction
About the Data
The first file consists of United States export information which comes from the U.S. Census Bureau annually.  The data must have the proprietary information removed using disclosure rules that have been previously established by the Census Bureau.  In order to avoid disclosing sensitive information the HS code and the export count were removed from the data so pricing information for any single item will not be inadvertently released.  BIS will provide the public with the ECCN (Export Control Classification Number), the license type (the AES code the license was shipped under), the value of the license and the country of destination.  Information is only provided for licenses that are commerce jurisdiction.
