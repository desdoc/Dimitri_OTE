About the Data
The file comes from the United States Census Bureau annually and must have the proprietary information removed using disclosure rules that have been previously established by the Census Bureau.  The Data consists of United States export information.  The HS code and the export count were removed from the data in order to avoid disclosing information leading to trade secrets.  BIS will provide the public with the ECCN (Export Control Classification Number), the license type (the AES code the license was shipped under), the value of the license and the country of destination.  Information is only provided for licenses that are commerce jurisdiction.
